\AccessSecrets{3}{Long-living secrets}{Our secrets are long-lived and can be reused when they get leaked.}

\AccessSecrets{6}{Slow credential rotation}{We don't propagate changes in permissions quickly enough throughout the whole system.}
\AccessSecrets{7}{Repudiation}{We can't trace back whether authenticated users/developers granted themselves additional permissions.}
\AccessSecrets{8}{No least privilege}{We don't restrict permissions (developers, technical users) to the minimum, allowing for a privilege escalation.}
\AccessSecrets{9}{Privilege escalation}{Our Identity and Access Management lets authenticated users/developers grant themselves additional permissions.}
\AccessSecrets{10}{No MFA}{We don't enforce MFA for developer access.}
\AccessSecrets{J}{Secrets in artifacts}{Our deployment artifacts contain secrets that can be extracted.}
